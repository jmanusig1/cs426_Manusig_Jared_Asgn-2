The entire map itself in the edges of the confined walls

Outcome

Non-plain-vanilla procedure/rule:
Dilemna - There is a fork in the road and the player has to choose between two paths: a hard but fast path and a slow but easy path.
Dilemna - You can choose to cooperate with your teammates, or be the first to finish the map.

How we followed the game theme: the cats are the main players, the music is the "smooth jazz nyan cat" song, and the environment reflects a motherboard, data pipelines, ram, cpu, cat backgrounds, and common cat food. Furthermore, there are questions in the game that ask about cats and computer science related topics.

Multiplayer Aspect: The game is a cooperative game where you work together to answer questions, solve mazes, and help eachother traverse the map. However, it can also be competitive because it is a race to the end. 

Executive Summary
“Jazzy Cats in a Computer” is a co-op competitive strategic game for Windows targeted at boys and girls of all ages.
